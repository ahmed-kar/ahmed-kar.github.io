**Abstract**  
ARIMAP introduces a hybrid algorithm combining the strengths of ARIMA and Prophet models to enhance time series forecasting. This approach addresses limitations in traditional methods, providing improved accuracy and adaptability for internal datasets at the London Stock Exchange. By integrating the predictive capabilities of both models, ARIMAP sets a benchmark for robust time series analysis in financial and operational applications.

This work is currently in progress, with the aim of formalizing findings into a comprehensive publication.
