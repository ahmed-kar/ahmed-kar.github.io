👨🏽‍💻 I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at the London Stock Exchange.

🔬 My research interests lie in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, and Open-Endedness.

📚 Currently, I’m developing innovative time series algorithms, including ARIMAP, to improve predictive accuracy for operational data.

📽️ I’m always open to collaborating on new research ideas or projects. Feel free to reach out if you find something intriguing!

# Selected Experience (Open to public)

## 🔥 Machine Learning for Wildfire Prediction

During my research at Imperial College London, I worked on analyzing satellite datasets using Quantum GIS and machine learning techniques like CNNs, ANNs, and Random Forests to study the relationship between forest fragmentation and wildfire propagation. This research contributed to defining fire regimes in tropical landscapes and was funded by the Leverhulme Centre for Wildfires, Environment, and Society.


## 📘 MSc Thesis: Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs for Automated Essay Scoring
For my MSc thesis, I explored uncertainty quantification techniques for large language models (LLMs) in the context of automated essay scoring. This work aimed to make AI-based scoring systems more interpretable and reliable by identifying and managing prediction uncertainties, a key requirement for high-stakes educational applications.

## 🤖 Combining RL and Exploration Techniques
I worked on integrating DreamerV2, a model-based reinforcement learning framework, with advanced exploration strategies. These included curiosity-driven exploration and episodic memory compression to enhance agent learning in sparse-reward environments. The project explored how combining intrinsic motivation and memory-based approaches can improve performance in complex RL tasks.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
  London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) | Machine Learning Engineer
  Developed ARIMAP, a novel algorithm combining ARIMA and Prophet, showing superior performance in specific forecasting contexts.
  Contributed to Enigma, an internal chatbot leveraging RAG and LLMs for efficient data retrieval and internal communication.
  Worked on a Self-Healing Machine Learning System, automating anomaly detection and remediation using StackStorm and Control M.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I am planning to launch a blog page and a YouTube channel to present papers,findings and just really sharing anything I find interesting. I also find the best method of learning is teaching.
