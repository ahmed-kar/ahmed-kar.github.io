This project explored the combination of **DreamerV2**, a model-based RL framework, with advanced exploration techniques. By incorporating **curiosity-driven exploration** and **episodic memory compression**, the project aimed to improve performance in sparse-reward environments. The work focused on how intrinsic motivation can boost agent learning and adaptability in complex tasks.
