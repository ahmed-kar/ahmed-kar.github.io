In this project, I analyzed wildfire data using **Quantum GIS**, satellite datasets (MODIS, Global Fire Atlas), and machine learning algorithms like CNNs, ANNs, and Random Forests. The research focused on understanding the interaction between forest fragmentation and wildfire patterns, contributing to defining fire regimes in tropical regions. This work was part of my research at **Imperial College London** and funded by the **Leverhulme Centre for Wildfires, Environment, and Society**.

My MSc thesis involved applying uncertainty quantification techniques to **large language models (LLMs)** in the context of automated essay scoring. This work highlights how identifying and managing prediction uncertainties can ensure reliability in high-stakes applications like education. The research bridges the gap between interpretability and scalability in AI-based scoring systems.

This project explored the combination of **DreamerV2**, a model-based RL framework, with advanced exploration techniques. By incorporating **curiosity-driven exploration** and **episodic memory compression**, the project aimed to improve performance in sparse-reward environments. The work focused on how intrinsic motivation can boost agent learning and adaptability in complex tasks.
