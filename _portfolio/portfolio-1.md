In this project, I analyzed wildfire data using **Quantum GIS**, satellite datasets (MODIS, Global Fire Atlas), and machine learning algorithms like CNNs, ANNs, and Random Forests. The research focused on understanding the interaction between forest fragmentation and wildfire patterns, contributing to defining fire regimes in tropical regions. This work was part of my research at **Imperial College London** and funded by the **Leverhulme Centre for Wildfires, Environment, and Society**.
